    Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications.
    Itâ€™s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world.
    Drupal is open source software maintained and developed by a community of 630,000+ users and
    developers. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (or "GPL"),
    which means anyone is free to download it and share it with others. This open development model
    means that people are constantly working to make sure Drupal is a cutting-edge platform that supports
    the latest technologies that the Web has to offer. The Drupal project's principles encourage
    modularity, standards, collaboration, ease-of-use, and more.
