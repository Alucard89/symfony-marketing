    <p>

        PPI is an open source php meta-framework. we have taken the good bits
        from Symfony2, ZendFramework2 &amp; Doctrine2 and combined them together
        to create a solid and very easy web application framework. PPI can be
        considered the boilerplate of PHP frameworks.
