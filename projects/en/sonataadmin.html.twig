        The goal of the Sonata Project is to provide an e-commerce framework
        solution based on the Symfony2 framework. Think of it as a toolkit
        based on Symfony2 components to make building e-commerce sites easy
        and fun!

        <br />
        Famous bundles are already available: Admin Bundle, Block Bundle, Media Bundle, ... and used by
        others projects like the Symfony CMF
