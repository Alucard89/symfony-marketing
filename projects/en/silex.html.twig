        Silex is a PHP microframework for PHP 5.3. It is built on the
        shoulders of Symfony2 and Pimple and also inspired by sinatra.

        A microframework provides the guts for building simple single-file apps. Silex
        aims to be:

        - Concise: Silex exposes an intuitive and concise API that is fun to use.
        - Extensible: Silex has an extension system based around the Pimple micro
        service-container that makes it even easier to tie in third party
        libraries.
        - Testable: Silex uses Symfony2's HttpKernel which abstracts
        request and response. This makes it very easy to test apps and the
        framework itself. It also respects the HTTP specification and encourages
        its proper use.
