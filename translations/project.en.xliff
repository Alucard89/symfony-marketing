                    Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications.
                    Itâ€™s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world.
                    Drupal is open source software maintained and developed by a community of 630,000+ users and
                    developers. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (or "GPL"),
                    which means anyone is free to download it and share it with others. This open development model
                    means that people are constantly working to make sure Drupal is a cutting-edge platform that supports
                    the latest technologies that the Web has to offer. The Drupal project's principles encourage
                    modularity, standards, collaboration, ease-of-use, and more.

                    Silex is a PHP microframework for PHP 5.3. It is built on the shoulders of Symfony2 and Pimple
                    and also inspired by sinatra. A microframework provides the guts for building simple single-file
                    apps. Silex aims to be : Concise: Silex exposes an intuitive and concise API that is fun to use.
                    Extensible: Silex has an extension system based around the Pimple micro service-container that
                    makes it even easier to tie in third party libraries. Testable: Silex uses Symfony2's HttpKernel
                    which abstracts request and response. This makes it very easy to test apps and the framework itself.
                    It also respects the HTTP specification and encourages its proper use.

                    Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be
                    an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of
                    development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication,
                    routing, sessions, and caching.
